# Notetaker

## by Doug Davidoff


### Purpose of the Project

The app is designed to allow the user to write, save, and discard a set of notes. The app saves the notes to a server in the cloud; thus the notes persist from session to session.

The User Story is:
-- AS A USER, I want to be able to write and save notes.
-- I WANT NOTES to be able to delete notes I've written in the past.
-- SO THAT I CAN organize my thoughts and keep track of taks I need to complete

### Location and Installation

The deployed website is located on Heroku at [https://fathomless-sierra-01381.herokuapp.com/notes.html](https://fathomless-sierra-01381.herokuapp.com/notes.html).

No installation steps are required. The app works immediately upon deployment. Begin writing a note. Use the "save to disk" icon to save a note. Use the "pencil" icon to write a new note. (This usually is not needed.) Use the "garbage pail" icon to permanently delete a note.

The repository for the app is located on GitHub at [https://github.com/dougdavidoff/notetaker](https://github.com/dougdavidoff/notetaker).


### Business Context

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistant notes allows users to have written information available when needed.


### Development

I received a lot of help for this app in a study-group session, especially from my classmate Brian Garrity.
